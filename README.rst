This project is owned and driven by Jane Curry ( jane.curry@skills-1st.co.uk ). 

The Guide is detailed documentation for Zenoss ZenPack developers. It is licensed under the

Zenoss Inc are part of the project but accept no liability for the document or its usage.

The document discusses a wide variety of ZenPack topics, including some detailed 
investigation of core Zenoss code and how the ZenPack developer can interface with it.

The Guide is built around a number of sample ZenPacks which, between them, explore:

* Zenoss architecture
* ZenPack architecture
*  Creating new object classes and relationships
*  The zenpacklib tool
*  Creating new collector modeler plugins to populate the new classes with data 
*  Converting old, non-zenpacklib ZenPacks to use zenpacklib
*  Creating code for web pages for new types of objects, both JavaScript and TAL
*  Creating new performance datasources and data templates 
*  Converting COMMAND-based ZenPacks to use the PythonCollector
*  Incorporating new event classes, triggers and notifications in ZenPacks
*  Creating and extending menus
*  Extending functionality using routers and facades
*  Logging and debugging
*  The process of ZenPack creation, GitHub and ZenPack submission to Zenoss 

The samples can be found here on GitHub under https://github.com/ZenossDevGuide 

The document will never be “finished”; always a “work-in-progress” as the product and knowledge 
of the product expands. Please read the Guide, try the ZenPacks and contribute comments back for
the next version.  A basic template document, in Word format, is provided.

Please use the ZenPack Development forum for discussions - http://www.zenoss.org/forums/zenpack-development .  
We could also try using the "Issues" tab on GitHub for feedback.
